**Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Using Python**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By examining key behavioral and service-related factors, the project identifies patterns that lead customers to stop using a service â€” a critical metric for businesses to monitor and reduce.

**Project Overview**
Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. This project uses a telecom dataset to:

Understand customer behaviors that influence churn

Preprocess and visualize data for insights

Build machine learning models to predict churn

**Dataset**
The dataset includes telecom customer information such as:

Customer demographics

Services subscribed (internet, phone, etc.)

Billing information

Tenure and contract type

Churn status (Yes/No)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
